      <h1>Why We Started VibeCrystals</h1>
      <p>
        Late-night coding, chess games that go to move 80, and a heart that
        still wants to feel grounded, spiritual, and aligned.

          <h2>Crystals for the New-Age Creative</h2>
          <p>
            We grew up on city lights, laptops, social media, and side hustles.
            At the same time, we felt called to something deeper — ritual,
            spirituality, and intentional living.
          </p>
          <p>
            VibeCrystals is our bridge between those worlds: modern life and
            ancient stones; high-tech and high-vibe.

          <h3>The First Setup</h3>
          <p>
            One amethyst by the keyboard. A little citrine by the camera. A
            thrift-store chess set on the desk. That was the first VibeCrystals
            “studio”. From there, the idea never left.

          <h3>Ethical Sourcing</h3>
          <p>
            We work only with suppliers who respect fair wages, safe working
            conditions, and the land crystals come from.

          <h3>Energy Over Aesthetic</h3>
          <p>
            A crystal doesn’t need to be Instagram-perfect to be powerful. We
            choose pieces for how they feel as much as how they look.
